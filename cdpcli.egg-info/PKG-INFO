Description: # Cloudera CDP Command Line Interface
        
        This package provides a unified command line interface to the Cloudera Data
        Platform (CDP) control plane API.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        * Python 3.6 or higher
        
        Earlier versions of Python are no longer supported for new releases, as of
        January 2021. Previous CLI releases shall continue to work under earlier Python
        versions.
        
        Starting with version 0.9.24, the requests and urllib3 libraries are no longer
        bundled with the CLI. When upgrading, watch for those new dependencies to be
        installed.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install using `pip` from the
        [cdpcli PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/cdpcli/):
        
        ```
        $ pip install cdpcli
        ```
        
        To install from source:
        
        ```
        $ git clone git@github.com:cloudera/cdpcli.git
        $ cd cdpcli
        $ pip install .
        ```
        
        ### Beta CLI
        
        An alternative CLI exposing beta functionality is available in its own package.
        
        ```
        $ pip install cdpcli-beta
        ```
        
        Do not install both the regular and beta CLIs in the same Python environment,
        as they use the same entry points and therefore conflict.
        
        Any features exposed in the beta CLI that are not available in the regular CLI
        are still under development. They are not yet supported, may not work, and are
        subject to change in incompatible ways, including removal. Do not rely on beta
        features for production use.
        
        ## Configuring
        
        API calls through the CDP CLI require a key pair issued from the CDP control
        plane. Use the CDP console to generate keys, following [documented
        instructions](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/cli/topics/mc-cli-generating-an-api-access-key.html).
        Then, run `cdp configure` to provide the credentials to the CLI.
        
        ```
        $ cdp configure
        CDP Access Key ID [None]: xxx
        CDP Private Key [None]: yyy
        ```
        
        Credentials are stored under the "default" profile in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials*,
        using the ini file format.
        
        ```
        [default]
        cdp_access_key_id = xxx
        cdp_private_key = yyy
        ```
        
        ### Profiles
        
        If you need to access the API as more than one user, set up a named profile for
        each user. Each profile stores a separate set of credentials.
        
        ```
        $ cdp configure --profile my-other-user
        ```
        
        The credentials for a profile are stored in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials* under a
        section named for the profile.
        
        ### Credential Environment Variables
        
        An alternative to storing credentials in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials* is to pass
        them using the environment variables `CDP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `CDP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
        However, these variables are ignored when the `--profile` option is used when
        running the CLI (see below).
        
        ### Base Endpoint URL and Form Factor
        
        The CLI may be used to access
        [CDP Private Cloud](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/overview/topics/cdppvc-overview.html)
        control planes. Contact your control plane administrator to obtain the required
        base endpoint URL value for your installation. Set the value in
        *$HOME/.cdp/config*, another configuration file that uses the ini file format.
        Create a section named for the profile which should work with the private cloud
        control plane.
        
        ```
        [profile private1]
        cdp_endpoint_url = https://cdp-private.example.com
        ```
        
        The CLI guesses whether it is using CDP Public Cloud or CDP Private Cloud based
        on the base endpoint URL. If you find that it is guessing incorrectly, you can
        configure use of either *form factor* in *$HOME/.cdp/config*. Valid form factor
        values are "public" and "private".
        
        ```
        [profile private1]
        form_factor = private
        ```
        
        ## Running
        
        Basic syntax:
        
        ```
        cdp [options] <command> <subcommand> [parameters]
        ```
        
        Examples:
        
        ```
        $ cdp iam get-user
        $ cdp environments describe-environments --environment-name myenv1
        ```
        
        ### Help
        
        For general help, use any of these commands.
        
        ```
        $ cdp help
        $ cdp --help
        $ cdp # no arguments
        ```
        
        Most CLI commands correspond to API services. Subcommands correspond to
        operations in services.
        
        * For help on any command, run its `help` subcommand, or pass the `--help` parameter.
        * For help on any subcommand, pass the `help` or `--help` parameter.
        
        The same help content is available in online
        [API documentation](https://cloudera.github.io/cdp-dev-docs/api-docs/).
        
        ### Profiles
        
        By default, the CLI uses credentials in the "default" profile. Use a different
        profile by passing the `--profile` option.
        
        ```
        $ cdp --profile my-other-user iam get-user
        ```
        
        ### Base Endpoint URL and Form Factor
        
        By default, the CLI works with
        [CDP Public Cloud](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/overview/topics/cdp-overview.html)
        and calculates API endpoints accordingly. If you are using CDP Private Cloud, be
        sure to provide the base endpoint URL for your private cloud control plane. You
        can do so by setting it in *$HOME/.cdp/config* for the desired profile, or
        through the `--endpoint-url` option, which supersedes the configuration.
        
        ```
        $ cdp --endpoint-url https://other.cdp-private.example.com ...
        ```
        
        The CLI guesses whether it is using CDP Public Cloud or CDP Private Cloud based
        on the base endpoint URL. If you find that it is guessing incorrectly, you can
        force use of either *form factor* by either setting it in *$HOME/.cdp/config*
        for the desired profile, or through the `--form-factor` option, which supersedes
        the configuration. Specifying a form factor does not alter the base endpoint URL
         in use.
        
        ```
        $ cdp --form-factor private ...
        ```
